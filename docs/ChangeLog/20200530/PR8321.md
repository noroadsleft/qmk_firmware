# Converting V-USB usbdrv to a submodule

[#8321](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/8321) and [qmk_compiler#62](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_compiler/pull/62).

These PRs move the V-USB driver code out of the qmk_firmware repository and into a submodule pointed at https://github.com/obdev/v-usb. This will make it easier to update the codebase if needed, while applying any potential QMK-specific modifications by forking it to the QMK GitHub organization.
