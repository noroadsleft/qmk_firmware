# Refactor of TKC1800 to use common OLED code

[#8472](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/8472) Modifies the default firmware for TKC1800 to use the in-built I2C and OLED drivers, instead of including and depending on its own set of libraries for the following functionality:
- SSD1306 display
- i2c for OLED

This allows current TKC1800 firmware to advance with updates to those drivers, which are shared with other keyboards.

## To migrate existing TKC1800 firmware:

[Changes to `config.h`](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/8472/files#diff-d10b26e676b4a55cbb00d71955116526):
- Remove `#define SSD1306OLED` from config.h

[Changes to `tkc1800.c`](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/8472/files#diff-3b35bd30abe89c8110717c6972cd2cc5):
- Add the following to avoid debug errors on HID_listen if the screen is not present
```c
void keyboard_pre_init_kb(void) {
  setPinInputHigh(D0);
  setPinInputHigh(D1);

  keyboard_pre_init_user();
}
```

[Changes to `keymap.c`](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/8472/files#diff-05a2a344ce27e4d045fe68520ccd4771):
- Find/Replace each instance of `#ifdef SSD1306OLED` with `#ifdef OLED_DRIVER_ENABLE`
- The following changes are for compatibility with the OLED driver. If you don't use the OLED driver you may safely delete [this section](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/e6b9980bd45c186f7360df68c24b6e05a80c10dc/keyboards/lily58/keymaps/default/keymap.c#L144-L190)
- [Remove](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6260/files#diff-20943ea59856e9bdf3d99ecb2eee40b7L91-L158) the block
```c
#ifdef SSD1306OLED	
  iota_gfx_init(!has_usb());   // turns on the display	
#endif
```
- Within the block bounded by `#ifdef OLED_DRIVER_ENABLE` and `#endif // OLED_DRIVER_ENABLE`, add the following block to ensure that your two OLEDs are rotated correctly across the left and right sides:
```c
oled_rotation_t oled_init_user(oled_rotation_t rotation) {
  if (!is_keyboard_master())
    return OLED_ROTATION_180;  // flips the display 180 degrees if offhand
  return rotation;
}
```
- Remove the function `iota_gfx_task_user`
